    136 facts every web dev should know before they burn out and turn
    to landscape painting or nude modelling
    
    Everything I’ve learned about web development in the almost
    twenty-five years I’ve been practising. All boiled down into a
    neat little list that I put together over a week.
    
    I’m Icelandic, so I’m prone to absolute statements. It’s a cultural thing.
    
    No, I’m not going to explain any of these.
    
    -   There are exceptions to most rules.

    -   Web development becomes more complicated the more you pull it
        apart and less so the more you step back.

    -   The best way to improve software UX is regular direct
        observation, by everybody on the team, of the work done.

    -   Software development needs to support the needs of those in
        the organisation. Otherwise, its ability to serve the needs of
        the customer will fall apart in short order.

    -   You may think that software development at a software company
        serves the customer directly, but you’d be mistaken. The
        organisation is the software development team’s primary
        customer.

    -   One of the biggest problems in web development, specifically
        and software development in general, is
        [failure demand](https://vanguard-method.net/failure-demand/).
        [“Failure demand is demand caused by a failure to do something or do something right for the customer."](https://vanguard-method.net/library/systems-principles/failure-demand/)
        (John Seddon, 2003).

    -   Examples of failure demand in software development:

        -   Having to rewrite code because, while you fulfilled the
            documented requirements, you didn’t meet the
            organisation’s actual needs.

        -   Having to spend all your time fixing bugs. Your sole focus
            at the start of the project was delivering features. Now
            you don’t have time to do your work cleanly *without
            creating bugs* because all your time goes into fixing
            them.

        -   Building the wrong product because you didn’t understand
            the needs of the customer.

        -   Spending all your time deploying or testing by hand
            because you never spent time on automation.

        -   Having to redo a feature because the spec was unclear.

        -   And more.

    -   Most software projects consume 5x, 10x, 20x more resources
        than they should because failure demand consumes most of the
        organisation’s resources.

    -   HTML is fantastic. Even if you can do a task without it, keep
        using HTML to manage, update, or encapsulate your CSS or JS
        work. (Custom Elements!)

    -   Everybody has small screens, and they all know how to scroll:
        only make UI widgets ‘sticky’ or ‘fixed’ if you have to. They
        know where your navigation bar is. You don’t have to push it
        in their face the whole time.

    -   Everybody has small screens, and they all know how to scroll:
        make sure that what they see when the page loads tells them
        there is something below the fold. They will scroll down if
        they have the slightest reason to. If only to see how dumb
        your work is.

    -   Everybody has small screens, and they all know how to scroll:
        scroll position is a part of the application’s core
        state. Preserving scroll position across navigations is an
        easy UX win.

    -   If the user has big screens, make use of them. When you have
        space, opt for detail over decoration, data over branding,
        buttons and navigation over menus.

    -   Sturgeon’s law applies to your work as well. Don’t linger on
        one project forever. Make new things. That’s the only way to
        learn.

    -   The trick is to recognise when it’s time to move on.

    -   A visitor to your site begins by building a map of it in their
        heads. Because without that internal map, nothing they will
        ever do on your site will fully make sense to them because it
        has no context.

    -   Context is essential.

        -   Show them what you got, yes, but show it to them in
            context.

        -   Visible context is always preferable to the context that
            has been shuffled off into a hidey-hole somewhere.

        -   See above about using the big screen if you have it.

    -   Use multiple screens if you can. The web is hypertext. Your
        app can exist on anything that can load an URL over HTTP. Try
        and do something useful with it.

    -   Have some personality: web dev is a pop culture and rewards
        personality. It doesn’t necessarily reward originality or
        quality but, as long as you don’t let us down elsewhere, it
        does reward having character.

    -   Have some personality:

        -   MID (Medium-Inspired Design) is mediocre.

        -   Everything looks the goddamn same. Same sans serif
            fonts. Same flat illustrations. Same colour
            schemes. Same. Same. Same.

        -   You can get away with looking boring if something else
            about your work is inventive but not if the whole thing
            you’re doing is by-the-numbers.

        -   Even if what you’re making is original, why not look
            memorable while you’re at it?

    -   Most products don’t need the features that SPAs provide. Teams
        need SPAs but not for the product itself. SPAs make for great
        demos and lovely presentations, which leads to more support
        for the team, more funding, and that way, SPAs improve the
        odds of success.

    -   Then SPAs take away what they give because they are
        error-prone and costly to develop. So much state to track. So
        many built-in features to reimplement.

        -   The first rule of SPAs: we always underestimate the
            complexity of handling state. Often by a large margin.

        -   The second rule of SPAs: we always underestimate the
            complexity of reimplementing history and link
            navigation. Often by a large margin. But we get away with
            not caring because nobody tests history management
            properly.

    -   SPAs are too much work: take the time and money you’d spend on
        SPAs and frameworks and spend it on the UX design
        instead. SPAs aren’t necessary for good UX design. Animation
        and swishy transitions aren’t good interactivity
        design. (“Design is how it works.") Which reminds me.

    -   Every SPA I’ve ever used has at some point let me down when it
        comes to navigation or history management:

        -   Resetting a view when you click the back button (browsers have an excellent back-forward cache! Use it!).

        -   Not loading the correct view.

        -   Failing to load a part of the screen.

        -   Losing data/context when opening a link in a new tab.

        -   Or just giving up altogether.

        -   They all fuck up at some point. Server-routed sites aren’t
            perfect, but there’s a lot less that can go wrong.

    -   Every SPA breaks the back button in some way. Often it won’t
        let you ‘back’ out of a site, where it always redirects you
        forward again whenever you hit the initial page that sets
        everything up. Other times it’s a more subtle error, but they
        all break it somehow.

    -   Design is what we do. Design is what the user does. Design is
        our actions that result in a field of possibilities for the
        user. The web is an interactive medium. If it isn’t something
        done by somebody – the digital embodiment of an action
        somebody has taken – then it is garbage, and you should do
        away with it.

    -   Minimalism is garbage. Simplicity is great, but minimalism
        sucks. Everything you see on the screen should have a reason
        to be there (be an embodiment of ‘doing’), but if the reasons
        are complicated, then the design should represent that
        complexity. Hiding complications makes everything harder, and
        excessive minimalism is just as harmful as excessive
        decoration.

    -   Data processing is not a complication. That can safely be
        shuffled off into the background or behind an abstraction.

    -   Complication is something involved that the user has to be
        aware of or do. If it’s something to be automated or handed
        off, then you still can’t get away with hiding away.

    -   Feedback loops are what interfaces run on, and hiding details
        away is a surefire way of breaking a feedback loop.

    -   Decoration is like junk food. It’s great in moderation. A
        little bit here and there is necessary to give life colour and
        vividness. But too much of it will kill you.

    -   You still need some decoration. See ‘have a personality’
        above. But not as much as you think because—

    -   It isn’t decoration if it changes the ‘doing’. When it frames
        something and changes its meaning, it’s a frame (parergon if
        you’re a Derrida fan).

    -   It isn’t decoration if it changes the ‘doing’. Styling Tetris
        so that it’s now a game about stacking bodies in a mass grave
        isn’t decoration but design. Horrifying, but still a design.

    -   Metaphors are fantastic. When you combine them with thoughtful
        visual design, they can transform a by-the-numbers web service
        or app into something groundbreaking.

    -   Naming things is fantastic. Everything on the screen should
        have a name. It’s better for your work. It’s better for
        accessibility. It’s better for your design. Take a table view
        and name it ‘Inbox’, ‘Screener’, or ‘Paper Trail’, and they
        suddenly mean something. What you do with them has changed. A
        good name transforms design and action.

    -   Prefer HTML over CSS over Images over Typefaces over
        JavaScript, in that order. Roughly.

    -   Don’t be mean. Make sure that undo works. And don’t get hung
        up on complex computer science. ‘Undo’ in this context means
        ‘can I make it right if I do something I immediately regret?’
        Put a slight time delay on the action. Fake those deletes for
        a few hours. Every update should preserve the version you are
        replacing somewhere, even if it’s only in this one tab on this
        one device. That way, you can give them one level of
        undoing. They already regret having to use your app; don’t
        make them regret you were ever born. (Too late! Hah!)

    -   Use URLs, links, and hypertext. Try not to hardcode
        relationships or URLs.

    -   Use URLs from links with rel values over URLs in attributes
        over URLs in properties over URLs in source code. Do it in
        that order. Apply that to anything that speaks HTTP in your
        app.

    -   Try to write HTML that would make sense and be usable without
        the CSS. Not because you ever expect that to happen
        (**cough**reader modes**cough**) but because that way you get
        a ton of freebies: appropriate default styles and built-in
        default behaviours. HTML-first means less work overall, both
        in styling and interactivity, because you start by seeing how
        much work HTML can provide before you step up to other layers.

    -   Try to write HTML that works and is usable without JS. Not
        because you ever expect that to happen, but because that way
        you get a ton of freebies: built-in input validation, form
        submission through a variety of input modes, UI widgets that
        are accessible out of the box, link navigation that fully
        supports the options the user’s OS provides.

    -   Try to write your CSS in layers.

        -   A settings stylesheet that collects all of your base
            variables.

        -   A base stylesheet that serves as the foundation.

        -   Layout stylesheets. Each one should implement a layout or
            composition without depending on other stylesheets.

        -   Block stylesheets that are the motif to your composition,
            the phrases in your structure, the recurring themes of
            your design.

        -   And the utilities that do one thing and one thing only.

    -   Load your styles *in that order*. Your utilities should
        override your motifs, your motifs should override your
        compositions, your compositions should override your element
        styles, and the variables from everything else should override
        your default variables. Use the cascade, Luke! Use the
        cascade!

    -   Style JS-driven state using ‘data-*’ attributes, style app
        design using classes, and style defaults using elements. Don’t
        let JS drive classes if you can help it. And don’t set style
        defaults using the class attribute.

    -   Only target CSS with the ID selector as a last resort. IDs are
        already used by JS, ARIA attributes, link navigation, input
        labelling, and more. Even without specificity issues, the ID
        attribute would be too overloaded, too tightly coupled to
        other layers in the web stack, to be anything but trouble.

    -   Only use the ID selector in your CSS as a last resort to fix
        extreme and hard-to-solve specificity issues. Try doubling up
        on a class first. `.class.class` is a valid selector and can
        work wonders.

    -   A specificity problem that’s hard to solve without
        `!important` usually means you haven’t thought through the
        structure of your CSS. Reaching for that `!important` instead
        of refactoring means you’re letting your CSS rot: technical
        debt is piling up.

    -   Because of the cascade, CSS is more sensitive to structure
        than most other code. You probably should refactor your
        stylesheets more often than you do your JS.

    -   Add IDs to every landmark and every paragraph if your tools
        let you. It’s rare to find a widely supported API that is
        usable by a broad section of the population. Links with
        fragment selectors are one of them. But to make them work,
        your HTML needs to have IDs.

    -   Make the problem browser your development home. If Firefox
        always gives you pain, live in it. Make it your work
        browser. Almost all of your Firefox-specific problems will
        disappear because you end up fixing them as you go, without
        thinking. Tight feedback loops are magic.

    -   The only exceptions to this are the mobile browsers because
        mobile OSes are garbage. They don’t let you do any real work
        or development. Maybe they work for you. Great for you. But
        the inflexibilities of mobile OSes mean that they just can’t
        serve the variety that desktop OSes do. Which means that—

    -   Mobile websites are always going to suck. They’re going to
        suck for development. They are going to suck for users. We can
        put in the work to make sure they don’t suck for the user, but
        that just means they suck extra hard for us.

    -   Tight feedback loops are magic: live reloading is magical. Hot
        module replacement less so. With live reload, your development
        browser automatically reloads your dev page when your code
        changes. If you suck and your page loads slowly, then you
        suffer. Hot module replacement hides the pain and lets you
        pass the suffering onto the user.

    -   Tight feedback loops are magic: build processes suck. They
        will always suck because they always loosen up the feedback
        loop. You can make builds quicker, but until they are
        virtually instantaneous, they will always suck. (Which could
        happen. *waves towards esbuild*.) If you can make something
        without a build step, do so. If you can make something without
        compilation or building, do that.

    -   Svelte and Typescript are very useful, but the cost of
        building is always more than you think, especially once the
        codebase grows.

    -   JS building adds the most value when you have many
        dependencies. In that case, it’s essential. But if you have
        few to no dependencies, most of the caveats about not building
        your JS go away. If you find yourself in that position: skip
        the build.

    -   Dependencies suck; dependencies rule. Other people’s code is
        like getting other people’s work for free. The downside is
        that it comes with their opinions, hobbies, and hygiene
        attached. All code comes bundled with a code smell. Usually,
        there isn’t anything you can do to prevent it from stinking up
        the place.

    -   Every dependency you use has security issues: if you don’t
        check them all to see if their issues are ones you can live
        with, then you’re probably going to pay for it later.

    -   Sometimes, the best thing an open-source project can do is
        demonstrate how you solve a problem. Adding it as a dependency
        afterwards is often a huge mistake.

    -   The job of development is to build a theory in your mind about
        the codebase.

    -   Too many dependencies can make that harder, not easier. Having
        too many dependencies can obfuscate the work that you are now
        having done for you by proxy.

    -   The developers' mental model of the codebase is what keeps it
        alive.

    -   DRY (don’t repeat yourself) is a luxury for when you have a
        coherent theory in your mind of the app’s code.

        -   It’s for when you have that theory contained in a
            worldview in your mind that helps you quickly test out
            decisions and plans against that theory.

        -   Until then, you should repeat yourself. Seeing your code
            repeat itself – when rhyming phrases start to pop up
            throughout – is a vital tool for building a theory about
            your app.

    -   Avoid using web workers (the web stack’s equivalent for a
        process) or threads if you can. They make theory-building
        harder. Only use them when they can be wrapped in a nice
        metaphor and modelled as standalone services or isolated
        functions, like a service worker or an unzip utility.

    -   Dependencies can sometimes do what you would never do, use bad
        ideas, take risks you never would. At least that way, when
        something blows up, you have someone else to blame.

    -   Of course, you chose to add the dependency, so either way, you
        are responsible.

    -   Despite what you may think, offline-first isn’t
        essential. It’s a lot of work, changes everything you make in
        the app, and, while everybody loves it when they need it,
        almost nobody will pay for it. Given two options, the odds are
        that buyers will buy the one that doesn’t support
        offline. (‘Buyer’ here being anything from an end consumer to
        an in-house stakeholder.) Why? Because it’s almost certainly
        cheaper and more reliable in a highly connected environment.

    -   The buyer is quite often wrong. That fact never changes their
        mind.

    -   Working on a functioning app’s codebase does more to increase
        its quality than adding features.

    -   Managers will always undervalue plain old code work.

        -   Working on an iffy codebase (and they all start iffy) to
            make it cleaner, more sensible, and more robust without
            adding features or functionality can save you weeks if not
            months of future work.

        -   Once you have a working app, working on code quality is
            just as likely to provide as much business value as a new
            feature.

        -   Managers will never, ever, ever be able to see or
            understand this.

        -   But a good manager doesn’t have to because they will give
            your team the autonomy to do things they don’t
            understand. A good manager will trust that you are working
            to address the organisation’s needs (and the needs of
            those in it) without arguing with you.

    -   A good manager *will* debate you, and that’s awesome.

    -   Fuck ups happen. Nobody is to blame even when somebody is
        responsible. Use it as an opportunity to see where the process
        didn’t work. And if you don’t have a process—well, that’s
        what’s wrong. Right?

    -   Fuck-ups happen. The run-up to the fuck-up is more interesting
        than the fuck-up itself. How did it happen? What made it get
        this far? Why didn’t anybody speak out sooner? Why didn’t
        somebody try to help sooner?

    -   Fuck-ups happen. Some people make it their mission in life to
        make sure that whenever a fuck-up happens, somebody will
        suffer. Don’t be that person, and don’t let that person get to
        you. They’re an ass.

    -   Fuck-ups happen, but they don’t always have to: a checklist
        does wonders. No, really. It will save your ass even without
        automation or coding.

    -   Every manager has an inappropriate love that will make life
        miserable for their reports. Some love meetings but will
        rarely put in the work to make those meetings worthwhile. Some
        love email but are incapable of putting together a coherent
        sentence.

    -   Prefer structured communications tools like an in-house blog,
        a wiki, Basecamp, Notion, or GitHub over unstructured
        messaging platforms like email or Slack. Your work has
        structure; so should your communications.

    -   Don’t rely too much on tools. They will let you down.

    -   Digital publishing is, for the most part, just a bunch of
        unrelated business models wrapped up in an exterior layer of
        design metaphors. Without the metaphors, it’s just sparkling
        websites.

    -   We have already baked in all of the downsides of XHTML into
        all of our dev tools. They tend to be stricter and more
        fragile than XML ever was and require you to use a pseudo-,
        often home-baked, markup format (*cough*JSX*cough*) that
        breaks just as often. Meanwhile, XHTML has semantic
        extensibility and native CSS support for extension
        namespacing. Both natively implemented by the browser. Not
        saying we should all switch back to XHTML (browser support is
        still there!) but I *am* saying XHTML had a lesson to teach
        us, but we didn’t pay attention and haven’t learned a thing.

    -   In other words: web dev is a pop culture with no regard for
        history, dooming each successive generation to repeat the
        blunders of the old, in a cycle of garbage software, wrapped
        in ever-escalating useless animations, transitions, and
        framework rewrites.

    -   The term ‘project’ is a poor metaphor for the horticultural
        activity that is software development.

        -   Some software is seasonal and has crops, but unless you
            want your business to end with the first harvest, you need
            to treat it like a living ecosystem.

        -   Some software components are perennial and
            evergreen. Others are seasonal and need regular
            replanting. The project metaphor treats them both the same
            and increases the risk of code rot.

    -   “Project management” is often used as a label for the somewhat
        helpful tools we use to organise work. Don’t let the project
        metaphor lead you to misuse these tools or to disregard them.

    -   Most project management software is garbage because
        organisations generally don’t lack the tools to manage
        work. You could replace most project management software with
        a spreadsheet with no issue. The problem all organisations
        have, which most think is a project management problem, is
        team and organisation communications.

    -   You can get away with simple management tools and tactics (a
        whiteboard and a spreadsheet) if your organisation has good
        trust and communications. Most *don’t*, however.

    -   Most ‘innovative’ tech startups face what I like to call ‘the
        clear field problem’. Whenever you have an app or business
        idea that nobody else seems to have done successfully before,
        it’s never because you are particularly clever or
        original. It’s always because everybody else who has tried is
        now dead in a ditch somewhere (metaphorically speaking).

    -   The only exception to this is when a brand new technical
        innovation opens up a new field. Which is rarer than you think
        as a better design doesn’t qualify as sufficient
        innovation. Unless you are the one who spent years developing
        that innovation from scratch, you are only performing
        arbitrage. That’s a recipe for squashed margins and brutal
        competition.

    -   If you’re lucky, the first-mover advantage will save your
        ass. The odds are against you, though.

    -   Some fields, when unregulated, will inevitably get dominated
        by a monopolist or an oligopoly. Monopolies are never the good
        guys. Don’t aspire to become one.

    -   Any field with multiple successful competitors is good
        news. It means that there is demand, which you can tap in by
        addressing the problem in your way. In a sector with solid
        margins, this is an opportunity for design innovation to
        shine.

    -   Any field where all of the other competitors are free
        services, outdated desktop apps, open-source communities with
        no revenue, or wannabe startup cults burning through cash is a
        lethal minefield covered in a cloud of mustard gas.

    -   Never go up against a free service from a multinational. At
        least, never directly.

    -   Try to position yourself so that the free services from other
        companies complement your paid service.

    -   Try not to couple your service tightly with one provided by a
        multinational (free or paid). Almost all software is
        garbage. The problem with other people’s software is that they
        (justifiably) don’t care if it’s breaking your stuff.

    -   One (possible) exception is when you are an actual paying
        customer. Build your business on AWS by all means but be wary
        of making Google Docs the foundation of your service.

    -   You are occasionally warned against building an app that
        should just be a feature of some other app or service. This
        advice is unhelpful. Apps with limited scope that interoperate
        through shared file formats (usually text, sometimes images)
        are a great productivity enabler.

    -   What you should avoid is building apps that are complements to
        other, more successful services. That applies to direct ones,
        like plugins or extensions, and indirect ones like EPUB
        reading apps. All the money, power, and control is in the
        other service, which is a recipe for a miserable time.

    -   Counter-intuitively, the same type of app can complement or be
        standalone depending on the *file format*. An EPUB reader is
        almost always a support function for either an ebook library
        service or an ebook retailer, as those are pretty much the
        only ways people use EPUB files. A PDF reader, however, can be
        a sustainable business because the file format is a
        commodity. Anybody can make one. Anybody can read one. It’s
        used everywhere and by everybody.

    -   Commonly used file formats with robust ecosystems enable
        software diversification as no single tool has to solve all of
        the problems.

    -   HTTP, links and URLs are powerful, even if you aren’t working
        with HTML or JSON.

    -   Web software is generally rubbish. You can explain this, at
        least partially, by the dominance of APIs over file formats in
        web tech circles.

    -   A service that requires a new file format is going to have a
        hard time. It’s going to have an even harder time if it is
        competing with a service that works with standard file
        formats, even when the former is objectively better for the
        problem at hand.

    -   Your service will have difficulties competing if it expects
        its API to solve the same problems for its users as a standard
        file format would.

    -   Any field where all of the other competitors have five (or
        more) salespeople for every developer isn’t going to be
        pleasant for the developer, no matter if they’re an employee
        or a founder. Probably great if you’re a salesperson, though.

    -   People lie when you do research. Watching what they do for an
        hour will tell you more than a hundred hours of interviews.

    -   People lie when you do research but pay attention to the tools
        they reach for, the pains they describe, because those can
        reveal threads you can pull on to unravel your way to the
        actual problem. It takes practice, though.

    -   Web dev is pop culture. Don’t get too stuck on
        trend-du-jour. Give it enough time and what was old is new
        again.

    -   Web dev is pop culture. You have two choices: keep up with the
        trends or have enough individuality to be timeless. (Which is
        easier said than done, though.)

    -   Web dev is pop culture, and managers have no taste. Most
        managers have no taste or judgement of their own when it comes
        to web development. The only tools they have to assess web dev
        are current trends and fashions in web dev pop culture. There
        is nothing you can do about this. Try to either find a manager
        with taste (rare!) or find one that trusts their developers to
        do the job despite not understanding the details.

    -   Trust is a recurring theme when it comes to teamwork. Clear
        communications and trust will smooth over a lot of fuck-ups.

    -   A solid business model will smooth over a lot of fuck-ups. You
        can get away with a bit of mismanagement if your margins are
        big enough.

    -   It all comes down to needs. If an organisation isn’t
        addressing the employees' needs, nothing in the organisation
        will be sustainable in the long term.

    -   Your needs come first. Then come those of your
        co-workers. Both come before that of the customer and before
        that of your manager. You need to be healthy, learning about
        the task at hand, improving your mental model of the product,
        and building a theory of how the code works. Otherwise, you
        aren’t going to be able to address anybody else’s needs.

    -   A good manager will structure the organisation and processes
        so that the workers' needs, when fulfilled, will result in
        them being able to meet the customer’s needs.

    -   A bad manager will churn through employees like tissue paper,
        sacrificing their well-being for vague and distant business
        goals.

    -   The worst manager sacrifices their well-being as well as their
        employees' well-being.

    -   As Deming said: [‘nobody gives a hoot about
        profits’](https://deming.org/nobody-gives-a-hoot-about-profit/). The
        manager who cares about company profits doesn’t exist.

    -   A manager who seems to care about company profits is more
        dangerous than most. They are suffering from one or more
        psychological complication.

        -   “If the company does well, then I’m a good person.”

        -   “If we make money, then my mother will be proud of me.”

        -   “My dad—I mean the CEO—thinks I’m great.”

    -   A lack of self-awareness is always trouble. In yourself, it
        causes misery. In a co-worker, it causes tension. In a boss or
        manager, it spells disaster. The only person you can send to
        therapy is yourself. The rest require firm boundaries and
        [non-violent
        communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication).

    -   The web enables remote work. That doesn’t mean work in
        isolation. Pick your people. Choose your society.

    -   The web exists in many forms, all of them valid in some
        context. Sometimes SPAs are the right solution. Native apps
        can use parts of the web stack and use them
        well. Understanding each medium is the key to understand the
        form you have chosen. Each form lends itself to specific
        actions. [The medium is the
        message](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message).

    -   Most of the *major* web dev innovations over the past decade,
        at least, are optimisation functions designed to help
        dysfunctional organisations extract value from open source
        without blowing up. They serve to gloss over communications
        problems, subsidise training, offload recruitment costs onto
        somebody else, make it easier to collaborate on problems that
        aren’t actual problems. They help implement ideas that
        probably shouldn’t become a reality. All to suck value that
        ultimately was created by open-source software.

    -   Web dev frameworks are for organisations, not small software
        teams or individual developers. The value frameworks provide
        lies in bridging team boundaries: they create a shared
        understanding that aids in collaboration across groups,
        simplify messaging, and establish clear
        conventions. Frameworks turn teams in large organisations into
        service interfaces.

    -   Individual teams or individual developers don’t have that
        problem, so they get less value from a web dev framework. The
        more opinionated the framework is and the more of the web
        platform it abstracts away, the more its value proposition
        skews towards solving organisational problems and the less
        value it provides to individual teams.

    -   None of this applies to learning. Having experience using
        frameworks can be extraordinarily useful. Being able to use
        the powerful capabilities of the platform itself is also an
        advantage. Individual needs and priorities vary too much. The
        above framework heuristic isn’t always correct.

    -   Some tools feel more natural than others. Others remain opaque
        as hell. Which tool is which will vary from person to person,
        age to age, job to job.

    -   Sometimes it’s rewarding to work with a tool that clicks for
        you, gets you into that flow to just get things done.

    -   Sometimes the most rewarding thing to do is to work with a
        tool that *doesn’t* click, is hard as hell for you to
        understand, and feels like a never-ending slog.

    -   Sometimes all you need is a single web page with no
        interactivity.

    -   Sometimes deliberate complication is just plain fun, and that
        has value in and of itself.

    -   You could replace most web services and apps with a blog,
        wiki, forum, or spreadsheet. Your service needs to be much
        better.

    -   You could replace most web services and apps with a pen and
        paper. All forms of productivity, writing, or organisation
        software compete directly with pencils, notepads, and
        post-its. And those are amazing. They work offline, don’t need
        power, never need rebooting, are robust as hell, and cheap as
        chips. They also have decades or centuries of history. You
        need to either be 100x better or to enable activities that
        aren’t possible otherwise.

    -   Just because you did something to make the impossible possible
        doesn’t mean that it’s worthwhile or that anybody
        cares. Society has no obligation to reward hard work or new
        invention. Just because you made it possible doesn’t mean it’s
        sensible.

    -   Making the complex simple also isn’t worth anything in and of
        itself. What is worthwhile is when you encode knowledge,
        skills, and practices into an interactive design and make
        something that’s rare and exclusive, distributed and
        accessible.

    -   You could say that this is the contribution the web has made
        to the modern world that has had the most impact: things that
        once existed in isolation are now widespread and
        accessible. Connecting and conveying is the web’s killer app.

    Things I didn’t have time for:

    -   Reed’s law and Metcalfe’s law don’t mean what you think they
        mean.

    -   The germ theory of management.

    -   How most managers think that ‘autonomy’ means the freedom to
        do whatever you want as long as it’s what they think you
        should be doing.

    -   There’s no silver bullet.

    **How I Treat My Seasonal Affective Disorder**
    
    MAUREEN HERMAN
    
    2:36 PM FRI, SEP 17, 2021
    
    It's getting darker earlier. There's Christmas stuff out at
    Costco. You know what that means? The flat, tired, disinterested
    feeling you may be starting to feel is seasonal depression — which
    all humans experience to one degree or another because of
    circadian rhythms, serotonin and melatonin. But the further you
    are from the equator, the more severe the symptoms. But you can
    treat it with a special light.

    The severe version, when diagnosed, is called Seasonal Affective
    Disorder (S.A.D.). If you also have regular Depression the on top
    of this as I do, you must definitely arm yourself proactively.

    I knew I had the winter version but forgot how sensitive I was to
    any lack of sunlight until I moved from LA back to the Midwest. I
    forgot how bad it could get — until it did.

    I was diagnosed with S.A.D. in a study at University of Minnesota
    when I was 19 but was kicked out because my symptoms were so
    severe I was fucking up the control numbers.

    Anti-depressants work great for my "regular" depression but they
    didn't help with the increased symptoms from my seasonal
    affliction. My psychiatrist prescribed a light therapy lamp. I
    doubted it would do anything. IT TOTALLY FUCKING WORKED AND I WISH
    I'D USED IT ALL ALONG.

    But I had the right kind and used it the right way:

    1.  Light must be 10,000 Lux or more

    2.  Start late September and stop in mid-March

    3.  Use it 1-2 hours in morning if possible and at least 1-2 hours
        at night starting before it gets dark (I also leave it on
        throughout any cloudy or overcast day.) You're tricking your
        brain to thinking the day is longer.

    4.  IMPORTANT: Light must be 12-16 inches from face, just ABOVE
        eye level, and at a 45 degree angle off to the side—like the
        sun would hit your eyes if it were up (see photo).

    5.  Most of the cheap "SAD" lights aren't built to be used this
        way which sucks. They are angled up from below sitting on a
        desk and THIS DOES NOT WORK SO DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY

    6.  You need a tall and adjustable one. The best I've found is the
        Theralite Aura Light Therapy Lamp.

    Ward off the inevitable. It was life-changing for me.

-   The phenomenon of chills or goosebumps that come from a piece of
    music (or from any other aesthetic experience) is called frisson,
    and it's been one of the big mysteries of human nature since it
    was first described.
    
    FRISSON /free-sawn/
    
    aka "aesthetic chills" or "musical chills"
    
-   If the music so good it is sublime you might be experiencing
    "numinous".
    
    This word is for when something is so good that you can't help but
    detect a hint of divinity or spirituality in it. This is also good
    for when you have deep seated connection to your fellow humans,
    perhaps after some great work of good you all share in numinous
    solidarity.

-   Regarding frisson/numinous:

    Developers and Open Source authors now have a massive amount of
    services offering free tiers, but it can be hard to find them all
    to make informed decisions.
    
    This is a list of software (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, etc.) and other
    offerings that have free tiers for developers.
    
    The scope of this particular list is limited to things that
    infrastructure developers (System Administrator, DevOps
    Practitioners, etc.) are likely to find useful. We love all the
    free services out there, but it would be good to keep it on
    topic. It's a bit of a grey line at times so this is a bit
    opinionated; do not be offended if I do not accept your
    contribution.
    
    This list is the result of Pull Requests, reviews, ideas and work
    done by 500+ people. You too can help by sending Pull Requests to
    add more services or by remove ones whose offerings have changed
    or been retired.
    
    NOTE: This list is only for as-a-Service offerings, not for
    self-hosted software. For a service to be eligible it has to offer
    a free tier and not just a free trial. If the free tier is
    time-bucketed it has to be for at least a year. We also consider
    the free tier from a security perspective, so SSO is fine but I
    will not accept services that restrict TLS to paid-only tiers.

    Advanced Git Features You Didn’t Know You Needed
    
    git is very powerful tool which almost every developer needs to
    use on daily basis, but for most us it's usage is reduced to just
    a few commands such as pull, commit and push. To be efficient,
    productive and wield the full power of git however, one needs to
    know a few more commands and tricks. So, in this article we will
    explore some of the easy to use, remember and configure features
    of git, that might make your time dealing with version control so
    much more enjoyable.

    An Australian blogger who goes by the nom de plume The Graceful
    Patient created a pain scale for mental health.

    If you've ever visited a psychiatrist or therapist, chances are you
    might have filled out something more complicated, like a K10 (Kessler
    Psychological Distress Scale) questionnaire, for example. You can look
    it up but it's one of those 10-question forms where your answers are
    on a scale from 1 to 5 ("none of the time" to "all of the time", that
    sort of thing).

    While those have been proven to work and will still remain useful, the
    blogger (who is not a mental health professional) perceived a need for
    a simpler overall scale not unlike That 0–10 Pain Scale With The
    Smiley Faces but for mental illness instead of other forms of physical
    pain.

    I'm not certain whether mental health care teams will find this useful
    as a starting point but it seems like a *really* simple way to
    communicate with loved ones, at least in summary form.

    Donald Trump ordered his White House lawyer to stop Attorney
    General Jefferson Beauregard Sesssions from recusing himself
    from the Russia investigation.  Don McGahn gave up on that
    after career officials at the Justice Department told him they
    advised Mr. Sessions to recuse himself.  Sessions did so, and
    Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed former FBI
    director Robert Mueller as special counsel on the Russia
    matter.

-   <http://www.motoringbox.com/cars/entertainment/top-gear/why-jeremy-clarkson-hates-piers-morgan/>

    Piers Morgan is a shitty human being.

    Piers was forced to apologize on international television in
    1996 after an infamous Daily Mirror story about the Euro Cup.

    In 2000, Piers Morgan invested UKP 67,000 under his wife's
    name in a company called Viglin that he was about to release a
    story about.  After an investigation revealed his conduct
    violation, two financial columnists at the paper lost their
    jobs but he kept his.

    Piers was fired from the Mirror in 2004 for publishing fake
    photos of British troops abusing and mistreating Iraqi
    prisoners of war.  The paper apologized profusely for about a
    week in its front page headlines.

    In the early 2000's, Piers relentlessly stalked Sun journalist
    Jeremy Clarkson until he found photos of him hitting on his
    BBC producer.  Jeremy later punched Piers at a British
    journalism awards show.

    He also illeglly obtained peoples' voicemails.  (The News Of
    The World was shut down in 2011 because of another voicemail
    hacking scandal.)

            Regarding buying guns on the darknet

            the GAO tried to buy some guns (PDF) on the "surface web" and
            the dark web. on public gun sites, they made 72 attempts to
            buy guns after clearly saying "HELLO SIR I AM A <PROHIBITED>
            WHO WANTS TO BUY A GUN" and in almost every case the seller
            noped out. in the 11 cases where they didn't nope out the
            seller seemed to be attempted to scam them and in two cases
            they were successful in scamming the GAO. they were unable to
            sting a single seller.

            on the dark web, two of their seven attempts to purchase
            firearms were successful and resulted in an AR-15 with the
            serial number filed off and a fully automatic uzi. "In the
            five attempts where we did not ultimately purchase a firearm,
            the prospective seller stopped responding to our inquiries,
            stated the firearm was no longer for sale, refused to use an
            escrow account for payment, or experienced technical problems
            using the Dark Web marketplace.

            so there is at least one legit dnm supplier of fully automatic
            weapons.
