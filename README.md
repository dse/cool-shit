-   [**How I Treat My Seasonal Affective Disorder**](https://boingboing.net/2021/09/17/how-i-treat-my-seasonal-affective-disorder.html)
    
    Maureen Herman
    
    2:36 PM FRI, SEP 17, 2021
    
    It's getting darker earlier. There's Christmas stuff out at
    Costco. You know what that means? The flat, tired, disinterested
    feeling you may be starting to feel is seasonal depression — which
    all humans experience to one degree or another because of
    circadian rhythms, serotonin and melatonin. But the further you
    are from the equator, the more severe the symptoms. But you can
    treat it with a special light.

    The severe version, when diagnosed, is called Seasonal Affective
    Disorder (S.A.D.). If you also have regular Depression the on top
    of this as I do, you must definitely arm yourself proactively.

    I knew I had the winter version but forgot how sensitive I was to
    any lack of sunlight until I moved from LA back to the Midwest. I
    forgot how bad it could get — until it did.

    I was diagnosed with S.A.D. in a study at University of Minnesota
    when I was 19 but was kicked out because my symptoms were so
    severe I was fucking up the control numbers.

    Anti-depressants work great for my "regular" depression but they
    didn't help with the increased symptoms from my seasonal
    affliction. My psychiatrist prescribed a light therapy lamp. I
    doubted it would do anything. IT TOTALLY FUCKING WORKED AND I WISH
    I'D USED IT ALL ALONG.

    But I had the right kind and used it the right way:

    1.  Light must be 10,000 Lux or more

    2.  Start late September and stop in mid-March

    3.  Use it 1-2 hours in morning if possible and at least 1-2 hours
        at night starting before it gets dark (I also leave it on
        throughout any cloudy or overcast day.) You're tricking your
        brain to thinking the day is longer.

    4.  IMPORTANT: Light must be 12-16 inches from face, just ABOVE
        eye level, and at a 45 degree angle off to the side—like the
        sun would hit your eyes if it were up (see photo).

    5.  Most of the cheap "SAD" lights aren't built to be used this
        way which sucks. They are angled up from below sitting on a
        desk and THIS DOES NOT WORK SO DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY

    6.  You need a tall and adjustable one. The best I've found is the
        Theralite Aura Light Therapy Lamp.

    Ward off the inevitable. It was life-changing for me.

-   The phenomenon of chills or goosebumps that come from a piece of
    music (or from any other aesthetic experience) is called frisson,
    and it's been one of the big mysteries of human nature since it
    was first described.
    
    FRISSON /free-sawn/
    
    aka "aesthetic chills" or "musical chills"
    
-   If the music so good it is sublime you might be experiencing
    "numinous".
    
    This word is for when something is so good that you can't help but
    detect a hint of divinity or spirituality in it. This is also good
    for when you have deep seated connection to your fellow humans,
    perhaps after some great work of good you all share in numinous
    solidarity.

-   <https://free-for.dev/>

    Developers and Open Source authors now have a massive amount of
    services offering free tiers, but it can be hard to find them all
    to make informed decisions.
    
    This is a list of software (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, etc.) and other
    offerings that have free tiers for developers.
    
    The scope of this particular list is limited to things that
    infrastructure developers (System Administrator, DevOps
    Practitioners, etc.) are likely to find useful. We love all the
    free services out there, but it would be good to keep it on
    topic. It's a bit of a grey line at times so this is a bit
    opinionated; do not be offended if I do not accept your
    contribution.
    
    This list is the result of Pull Requests, reviews, ideas and work
    done by 500+ people. You too can help by sending Pull Requests to
    add more services or by remove ones whose offerings have changed
    or been retired.
    
    NOTE: This list is only for as-a-Service offerings, not for
    self-hosted software. For a service to be eligible it has to offer
    a free tier and not just a free trial. If the free tier is
    time-bucketed it has to be for at least a year. We also consider
    the free tier from a security perspective, so SSO is fine but I
    will not accept services that restrict TLS to paid-only tiers.

    Advanced Git Features You Didn’t Know You Needed
    
    git is very powerful tool which almost every developer needs to
    use on daily basis, but for most us it's usage is reduced to just
    a few commands such as pull, commit and push. To be efficient,
    productive and wield the full power of git however, one needs to
    know a few more commands and tricks. So, in this article we will
    explore some of the easy to use, remember and configure features
    of git, that might make your time dealing with version control so
    much more enjoyable.

    An Australian blogger who goes by the nom de plume The Graceful
    Patient created a pain scale for mental health.

    If you've ever visited a psychiatrist or therapist, chances are you
    might have filled out something more complicated, like a K10 (Kessler
    Psychological Distress Scale) questionnaire, for example. You can look
    it up but it's one of those 10-question forms where your answers are
    on a scale from 1 to 5 ("none of the time" to "all of the time", that
    sort of thing).

    While those have been proven to work and will still remain useful, the
    blogger (who is not a mental health professional) perceived a need for
    a simpler overall scale not unlike That 0–10 Pain Scale With The
    Smiley Faces but for mental illness instead of other forms of physical
    pain.

    I'm not certain whether mental health care teams will find this useful
    as a starting point but it seems like a *really* simple way to
    communicate with loved ones, at least in summary form.

    project after it became clear to them the American space

    Donald Trump ordered his White House lawyer to stop Attorney
    General Jefferson Beauregard Sesssions from recusing himself
    from the Russia investigation.  Don McGahn gave up on that
    after career officials at the Justice Department told him they
    advised Mr. Sessions to recuse himself.  Sessions did so, and
    Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed former FBI
    director Robert Mueller as special counsel on the Russia
    matter.

-   <http://www.motoringbox.com/cars/entertainment/top-gear/why-jeremy-clarkson-hates-piers-morgan/>

    Piers Morgan is a shitty human being.

    Piers was forced to apologize on international television in
    1996 after an infamous Daily Mirror story about the Euro Cup.

    In 2000, Piers Morgan invested UKP 67,000 under his wife's
    name in a company called Viglin that he was about to release a
    story about.  After an investigation revealed his conduct
    violation, two financial columnists at the paper lost their
    jobs but he kept his.

    Piers was fired from the Mirror in 2004 for publishing fake
    photos of British troops abusing and mistreating Iraqi
    prisoners of war.  The paper apologized profusely for about a
    week in its front page headlines.

    In the early 2000's, Piers relentlessly stalked Sun journalist
    Jeremy Clarkson until he found photos of him hitting on his
    BBC producer.  Jeremy later punched Piers at a British
    journalism awards show.

    He also illeglly obtained peoples' voicemails.  (The News Of
    The World was shut down in 2011 because of another voicemail

            Regarding buying guns on the darknet

            the GAO tried to buy some guns (PDF) on the "surface web" and
            the dark web. on public gun sites, they made 72 attempts to
            buy guns after clearly saying "HELLO SIR I AM A <PROHIBITED>
            WHO WANTS TO BUY A GUN" and in almost every case the seller
            noped out. in the 11 cases where they didn't nope out the
            seller seemed to be attempted to scam them and in two cases
            they were successful in scamming the GAO. they were unable to
            sting a single seller.

            on the dark web, two of their seven attempts to purchase
            firearms were successful and resulted in an AR-15 with the
            serial number filed off and a fully automatic uzi. "In the
            five attempts where we did not ultimately purchase a firearm,
            the prospective seller stopped responding to our inquiries,
            stated the firearm was no longer for sale, refused to use an
            escrow account for payment, or experienced technical problems
            using the Dark Web marketplace.

            so there is at least one legit dnm supplier of fully automatic
            weapons.

    Mike Cernovich:

    - promoted the false conspiracy theory known as Pizzagate

    - misinterpreted a tweet from 2009 in order to get Sam Seder
